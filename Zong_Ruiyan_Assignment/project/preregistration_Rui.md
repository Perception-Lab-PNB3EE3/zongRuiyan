# Study Information 

## 1. Title 

> Visuomotor Timing Ability Comparison Between Visual Experts and Musicians

## 2. Authors 

> Ruiyan Zong

## 3. Description 

> Sensorimotor Synchronization (SMS) refers to the coordination of rhythmic movement with external rhythmic stimuli, like auditory, visual and tactile [@whitton_sensorimotor_2023]. Tapping, as a series of discrete movements requiring explicit temporal control, is widely used to study SMS [@repp_sensorimotor_2005]. SMS is a phenomenon that is difficult to avoid, as demonstrated by @klemmer_rhythmic_1957;@klemmer_sequences_1967, who found that in tasks requiring rapid responses to isochronous auditory or visual stimuli, responses tended to precede the stimuli at shorter inter-onset intervals (IOIs), like anticipations [@engstrom_reaction-anticipation_1996; @fraisse_anticipation_1966]. However, the coordination of movement can change as the tempo of the pacing sequence increases, potentially leading to a lack of coordination, such as phase wandering, especially when participants are instructed to avoid in-phase synchronization [@smethurst_effect_2003]. Additionally, unintentional deviations from SMS can occur when a distractor sequence is present, causing participants to synchronize with the distractor without noticing [@repp_rate_2003].
>
> The ability to perform SMS is constrained by rate limits, which define the range of frequencies within which participants can synchronize with an isochronous sequence. The lower inter-onset interval (IOI) limit is determined by the maximum frequency at which the effector can move, with participants typically finding no difficulty in finger tapping at intervals of 150–200 msec. However, synchronization becomes challenging when the metronome IOI exceeds approximately 1.8 seconds, as responses begin to lag. The upper IOI limit appears similar for both visual and auditory sequences [@engstrom_reaction-anticipation_1996; @mates_temporal_1994], but the lower IOI limit for in-phase tapping with visual stimuli is much higher than for auditory stimuli. For instance, @repp_rate_2003 found that synchronization with a flashing light became impossible at IOIs shorter than about 460 msec. It is commonly agreed that tapping variability is generally greater for visual metronomes compared to auditory ones, indicating less consistent performance with visual stimuli [@kolers_rhythms_1985; @repp_sensorimotor_2013; @loras_timing_2012; @comstock_sensorimotor_2018].
>
> Dynamic visual displays can enhance the stability of visual synchronization. For example, replacing a flashing square with images of a finger in motion improved visuomotor synchronization performance [@hove_spatiotemporal_2010]. Despite these improvements, auditory stimuli generally remain superior for SMS. Studies have consistently shown better temporal resolution in the auditory modality and higher variability in tapping with visual sequences [@kolers_rhythms_1985; @repp_sensorimotor_2005; @loras_timing_2012]. Additionally, when an auditory distractor is introduced during visual metronome tasks, participants' tapping tends to shift toward the auditory rhythm, whereas visual distractors have minimal impact on synchronization with auditory targets. However, the design of experiments may influence these findings. @kurgansky_visuomotor_2008 explored how individuals "tune in" to visual metronomes and observed varying approaches, suggesting that the discrete nature of auditory rhythms aligns more closely with real-life rhythmic perception than the often discontinuous nature of flashing visual stimuli.
>
> To address these limitations, more effective visual stimuli have been developed. @bank_comparing_2011 introduced the "stepping stones" paradigm, where alternating light patches on a treadmill provided a spatial guide for walkers, improving synchronization. Similarly, @iversen_synchronization_2015 found that a bouncing ball produced SMS variability comparable to an auditory metronome, and @hove_synchronization_2013 confirmed its effectiveness, though auditory metronomes remained superior. Gan et al. further demonstrated that tapping to a bouncing ball was not less stable than tapping to an auditory metronome for IOIs between 500 and 900 ms, except at 300 ms, indicating that visual synchronization can match auditory performance under certain conditions. @zhan_visual_2022 even discovered that visual performance could surpass auditory performance in highly optimized conditions.
>
> Musical training has been shown to enhance SMS with visual stimuli. [@krause_perception_2010;@krause_functional_2010] found that drummers and pianists exhibited less variability than nonmusicians when tapping to a flashing circle. @hove_synchronization_2013 compared musicians and "visual experts" (e.g., video gamers and ball players) and found that musicians were more influenced by auditory distractors during visual metronome tasks, while visual experts showed the opposite pattern, with their taps more affected by visual distractors. This suggests that expertise shapes the way individuals synchronize with different stimuli. However, the way people with different rhythmic background synchronizing with visual stimuli is not fully clear yet. Building on @zhan_visual_2022 findings, this study aims to explore how visual experts and musicians differ in their synchronization with a bouncing ball, further investigating the potential for dynamic visual stimuli to approach or even surpass auditory SMS performance under optimized circumstances.



## 4. Hypotheses 

> Directional: 
> Visual experts (video gamers and ball players) will demonstrate more stable and accurate synchronization with a visual stimulus (bouncing ball) than musicians.

# Design Plan 
> Partcipants will be divided into 3 groups based on their experiences. Each of them will be presented a set of visual stimuli (bouncing balls). 
> The difference between the time of a tap and the time of the corresponding stimulus onset will be analyzed.

## 5. Study type 

> **Experiment** - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.

## 6. Blinding 
> Blinding describes who is aware of the experimental manipulations within a study. Mark all that apply.

- [x] No blinding is involved in this study.

- [ ] For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned.

- [ ] Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments. (Commonly known as “double blind”)

- [ ] Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the treatment applied to any given group.

## 7. Is there any additional blinding in this study? 

> N/A

## 8. Study design 

> We have a mixed design:
> 1 Between-Subjects Factor: Rhythmic-based experience (with 3 levels: video gamers, ball players, and musicians).
> 1 Within-Subjects Factor: velocity of a bouncing ball (with 3 levels: slow, medium, and fast).

Partcipants will be divided into 3 groups based on their experiences. Each of them will be presented a set of visual stimuli randomly (bouncing balls with different velocities) based on the experiment procedure described by Gan et al.(2015). 

> The difference between the time of a tap and the time of the corresponding stimulus onset (Relative Phase - Pi) will be analyzed to compare th visuomotor synchronization ability between visual experts and musicians .

## 9. Randomization 

> We will use simple randomization. Rhythmic visual stimuli (the bouncing ball) with different velocity will be presented to every participant.

# Sampling Plan 

## 10. Existing data 

> Preregistration is designed to make clear the distinction between confirmatory tests, specified prior to seeing the data, and exploratory analyses conducted after observing the data. Therefore, creating a research plan in which existing data will be used presents unique challenges. Please select the description that best describes your situation. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions about how to answer this question ([prereg\@cos.io](mailto:prereg@cos.io){.email}).

-   [x] Registration prior to creation of data: As of the date of submission of this research plan for preregistration, the data have not yet been collected, created, or realized.
-   [ ] Registration prior to any human observation of the data: As of the date of submission, the data exist but have not yet been quantified, constructed, observed, or reported by anyone - including individuals that are not associated with the proposed study. Examples include museum specimens that have not been measured and data that have been collected by non-human collectors and are inaccessible.
-   [ ] Registration prior to accessing the data: As of the date of submission, the data exist, but have not been accessed by you or your collaborators. Commonly, this includes data that has been collected by another researcher or institution.
-   [ ] Registration prior to analysis of the data: As of the date of submission, the data exist and you have accessed it, though no analysis has been conducted related to the research plan (including calculation of summary statistics). A common situation for this scenario when a large dataset exists that is used for many different studies over time, or when a data set is randomly split into a sample for exploratory analyses, and the other section of data is reserved for later confirmatory data analysis.
-   [ ] Registration following analysis of the data: As of the date of submission, you have accessed and analyzed some of the data relevant to the research plan. This includes preliminary analysis of variables, calculation of descriptive statistics, and observation of data distributions. Please see cos.io/prereg for more information.

## 11. Explanation of existing data 

> Not using any existing dataset for this experiment.

## 12. Data collection procedures 

> Participants will be recruited through advertisments on campus. 
> Participants will receive a chocolate for agreeing to participate in this study (raised to 2 chocolates if our sample size is not reached within 7 days of beginning recruitment ).
> Inclusion: Participants must be at 18 -35 years old to participate in this study. Normal or correct-to-normal vision is required.
> Exclusion: Participants with known neurological disease or cognitive difficulty will be excluded.

## 13. Sample size 

> 60 participants in total, aged between 18-35 years, with no known neurological disease will be recruited.
> Normal or correct-to-normal vision is required to participate in this study.
> Group 1 Video gamers: participants who regularily engage in games that requires precise timing (e.g., rhythm or action games) for 5 hours a week;
> Group 2 Ball players: participants who engaged in ball sports regularily (e.g., basketball, soccer, tennis) for over 2 years.
> Group 3 Musicians: participants with rich experience with playing rhythm-based instruments (e.g., drums, piano).

> Our target sample size is 54 participants. We will attempt to recruit up to 60, assuming that not all will complete the total task.

## 14. Sample size rationale 

>  We used the software program G\*Power to conduct a power analysis. Our goal was to obtain .95 power to detect a medium effect size of .25 at the standard .05 alpha error probability.

## 15. Stopping rule 

> We will post participant sign-up slots ever weekday, with 5 spots posted every weekday. We will post 25 new slots each week if, on that previous night, we are below 60 participants.

# Variables 

## 16. Manipulated variables 

> Independent Variable 1: rhythm-based experiences (auditory (musician) or visual (video game playes & ball sport players))
> Independent Variable 2: velocity of the dynamic visual stimuli (slow, medium, fast)
> 


## 17. Measured variables 

> The single outcome variable will be the tapping time.

## 18. Indices 

>  We will measure the difference between the tapping time and the onset of stimuli by the relative phase (RP) on a unit circle (-pi to pi).
> Synchronization stability will be indexed by R, which was the length of the resultant of the RPs and was calculated by abs (sum (exp (i∗RP))/n) (n indicated the number of the RPs) (Zhan et al., 2022)

# Analysis Plan 

> You may describe one or more confirmatory analysis in this preregistration. Please remember that all analyses specified below must be reported in the final article, and any additional analyses must be noted as exploratory or hypothesis generating.
>
> A confirmatory analysis plan must state up front which variables are predictors (independent) and which are the outcomes (dependent), otherwise it is an exploratory analysis. You are allowed to describe any exploratory work here, but a clear confirmatory analysis is required.


## 19. Statistical models 

> We will use repeated measures ANOVA to analyze our results. 
> The manipulated, categorical independent variable is 'RP' whereas the dependent variable is rhythm-based experience.


## 20. Transformations 

> We do not require any additional transformations.


## 21. Inference criteria 

>  We will use the standard p\<.05 criteria for determining if the ANOVA suggest that the results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis were correct.
> The means and standard deviation will also be calculated to make a general inference.


## 22. Data exclusion 

> Participants with extremely slow reaction time and huge shift in tapping will be excluded.
> As they could be affected by other factors such as fatique or unexpected events.



## 23. Missing data 

> If a participant have missing results or does not complete any of the trials of three velocity types, that subject will not be included in the analysis.

## 24. Exploratory analysis 

>  We expect that the length of rhythm-based experience may be related to the tapping performance. 
> Therefore, we will look for relationships between experience lengths (e.g., 2-year/ 5-year experience with tennis) and the primary outcome measures of differences with stimulus onset.
