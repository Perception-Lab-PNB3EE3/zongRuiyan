	abstract = {Sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) is the coordination of rhythmic movement with an external rhythm, ranging from finger tapping in time with a metronome to musical ensemble performance. An earlier review (Repp, 2005) covered tapping studies; two additional reviews (Repp, 2006a, b) focused on music performance and on rate limits of SMS, respectively. The present article supplements and extends these earlier reviews by surveying more recent research in what appears to be a burgeoning field. The article comprises four parts, dealing with (1) conventional tapping studies, (2) other forms of moving in synchrony with external rhythms (including dance and nonhuman animals’ synchronization abilities), (3) interpersonal synchronization (including musical ensemble performance), and (4) the neuroscience of SMS. It is evident that much new knowledge about SMS has been acquired in the last 7 years.},

	abstract = {This work investigates how spatial and temporal aspects of rhythmic movements are affected by spatial and temporal components of a visual pacing sequence. Participants synchronized finger taps with three visual pacing sequences (Flash, High Finger, and Low Finger) at two tempi (500 ms and 400 ms interonset interval). The Flash sequence contained only temporal information, whereas the two Finger sequences contained apparent motion of different amplitudes. Participants' finger movements were recorded with a motion capture system, and movement trajectories and timing accuracy were analyzed. Results indicated that apparent motion facilitates visuomotor synchronization accuracy, which likely stems from tight perception-action links. Stimulus amplitude modulated tap amplitudes in the same direction, but this spatial assimilation did not adversely affect timing accuracy. Flexion times toward the target were significantly shorter than extension or dwell times, and could indicate a relatively ballistic movement trajectory. Local deviations of tap timing correlated with the movement trajectories from the preceding and following movement cycle. For example, after a late tap, the following movement cycle had lower amplitude and shorter extension and dwell times. This could signify the workings of error correction mechanisms that ensure stable synchronization.},

Although this phenomenon has been studied for many years, the underlying neural and computational mechanisms remain unclear. Growing consensus suggests the existence of multiple, interacting, context-dependent systems, and that reduced precision in visuomotor timing might be due to the way experimental tasks have been conceived. Indeed, the appropriateness of the stimulus for a given task greatly inﬂuences timing performance. In this review, we examine timing differences for sensorimotor synchronization and error correction with auditory and visual sequences, to inspect the underlying neural mechanisms that contribute to modality differences in timing. The disparity between auditory and visual timing likely relates to differences in the processing specialization between auditory and visual modalities (temporal vs. spatial). We propose this difference could offer potential explanation for the differing temporal abilities between modalities. We also offer suggestions as to how these sensory systems interface with motor and timing systems.},

When one of these rhythms is the synchronization target and the other serves as a distracter at various temporal offsets, strong auditory dominance is observed. However, it has recently been shown that visuomotor synchronization improves substantially with moving stimuli such as a continuously bouncing ball. The present study pitted a bouncing ball against an auditory metronome in a target–distracter synchronization paradigm, with the participants being auditory experts (musicians) and visual experts (video gamers and ball players). Synchronization was still less variable with auditory than with visual target stimuli in both groups. For musicians, auditory stimuli tended to be more distracting than visual stimuli, whereas the opposite was the case for the visual experts. Overall, there was no main effect of distracter modality. Thus, a distracting spatiotemporal visual rhythm can be as effective as a distracting auditory rhythm in its capacity to perturb synchronous movement, but its effectiveness also depends on modality-speciﬁc expertise.},

In the current study, we examined how stimulus modality and rhythmic deviation, along with the synchronizer’s level of musicality, impacted sensorimotor synchronization (SMS). Utilizing a finger-tapping task and three sensory modalities (visual, auditory, and tactile), we manipulated rhythmic deviation by varying the temporal position, intensity, and availability of cues across four deviation levels. Additionally, to determine our participants’ musical familiarity and aptitude, we administered the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI) questionnaire. We found that SMS to external rhythmic stimuli was significantly more precise for auditory and tactile than for visual sequences. Further, we found SMS consistency significantly decreased in all modalities with increased rhythmic deviation, suggesting rhythmic deviation directly relates to SMS difficulty. Moreover, a significant correlation was found between Gold-MSI scores and SMS consistency in the most rhythmically deviant level, such that the higher one’s musical general sophistication score, the greater one’s SMS ability. This held for all three modalities. Combined, these findings suggest that rhythmic synchronization performance is affected not only by the modality and rhythmic deviation of the stimuli but also by the musical general sophistication of the synchronizer.},

            Daily music experience involves synchronizing movements in time with a perceived periodic beat. It has been established for over a century that beat synchronization is less stable for the visual than for the auditory modality. This auditory advantage of beat synchronization gives rise to the hypotheses that the neural and evolutionary mechanisms underlying beat synchronization are modality-specific. Here, however, we found that synchronization to a periodically bouncing ball with a realistic motion trajectory was not less stable than synchronization to an auditory metronome. This finding challenges the auditory advantage of beat synchronization and has important implications for the understanding of the biological substrates of beat synchronization.},

	abstract = {A striking asymmetry in human sensorimotor processing is that humans synchronize movements to rhythmic sound with far greater precision than to temporally equivalent visual stimuli (e.g., to an auditory vs. a ﬂashing visual metronome). Traditionally, this ﬁnding is thought to reﬂect a fundamental difference in auditory vs. visual processing, i.e., superior temporal processing by the auditory system and/or privileged coupling between the auditory and motor systems. It is unclear whether this asymmetry is an inevitable consequence of brain organization or whether it can be modiﬁed (or even eliminated) by stimulus characteristics or by experience. With respect to stimulus characteristics, we found that a moving, colliding visual stimulus (a silent image of a bouncing ball with a distinct collision point on the ﬂoor) was able to drive synchronization nearly as accurately as sound in hearing participants. To study the role of experience, we compared synchronization to ﬂashing metronomes in hearing and profoundly deaf individuals. Deaf individuals performed better than hearing individuals when synchronizing with visual ﬂashes, suggesting that cross-modal plasticity enhances the ability to synchronize with temporally discrete visual stimuli. Furthermore, when deaf (but not hearing) individuals synchronized with the bouncing ball, their tapping patterns suggest that visual timing may access higherorder beat perception mechanisms for deaf individuals. These results indicate that the auditory advantage in rhythmic synchronization is more experience- and stimulusdependent than has been previously reported.},

            2° Synchronization preciseness according to cadence tempo (from 375 ms to 6 000 ms between two successive sounds) appears to be excellent till 1 500 ms. Further, no actual synchronization between beat and sounds is to be found. But, when synchronization is carried out with a beat answering to each sound, as in series of reaction times, few variation appears in response cadence according to tempo. This kind of synchronization happens to be difficult when using fast cadence, lower than one per second. 3° Anticipation process is similar to tracking process : checks show that preparation for action get organized during all the time between two stimulus.

            1° L'établissement de la synchronisation frappes-sons à des cadences ou à des rythmes quand le S. doit frapper dès le premier son est très rapide. Dès le 3e stimulus (ou la 3e structure dans le cas d'un rythme simple), la simultanéité est réalisée à 50 ms près. La réorganisation après une perturbation ou un changement de rythme est aussi rapide.
            2° La précision de la synchronisation en fonction du tempo de la cadence (de 375 ms à 6 000 ms entre deux sons successifs) est excellente jusqu'à 1 500 ms. Au-delà, il n'y a plus de réelle synchronisation des frappes et des sons. Par contre, si la synchronisation est établie par réponse de la frappe à chaque son, comme dans une série de temps de réaction, la cadence des réponses varie peu en fonction du tempo. Cette forme de synchronisation est très difficile à réaliser par des cadences rapides, inférieures à une par seconde.
            3° Le processus d'anticipation est analogue à celui que l'on trouve dans les tâches de poursuite ; des contrôles montrent que la préparation à l'action s'organise progressivement pendant toute la période intermédiaire entre deux stimulus.},

            The concept of a temporal integration process in the timing mechanisms in the brain, postulated on the basis of experimental observations from various paradigms (for a review see P\$oUppel, 1978), has been explored in a sensorimotor synchronization task. Subjects synchronized their finger taps to sequences of auditory stimuli with interstimulus-onset intervals (ISIs) between 300 and 4800 msec in different trials. Each tonal sequence consisted of 110 stimuli; the tones had a frequency of 500 Hz and a duration of 100 msec. As observed previously, response onsets preceded onsets of the stimuli by some tens of milliseconcls for ISIs in the range from about 600 to 1800 msec. For ISIs longer than or equal to 2400 msec, the ability to time the response sequence in such a way that the response 5 were placed right ahead of the stimuli started to break clown, i.e., the task was fulfilled by reactions to the stimuli rather than by advanced responses. This observation can he understood within the general framework of a temporal integration puce 55 that is supposed to have a maximal capacity (integration interval) of approximately 3 sec. Only if successive stimuli fall within one integration period, can motor programs be initiated properly by a prior stimulus and thus lead to an appropriate synchronization between the stimulus sequence and corresponding motor acts.},
