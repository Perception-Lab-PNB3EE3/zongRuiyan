# Experiment Instructions

## Overview
This project analyzes reaction time differences in various participant groups (musicians, athletes, and a control group) based on simulated data. The analysis includes data simulation, data extraction, visualization, statistical analysis.

## Data Simulation
1. Data used in the analysis is randomly generated by adding noise, and variance on top of the actual data.
2. In simulation, all 6 trials consists of the bouncing ball with the same velocity. 
3. Files are saved as csv.
4. For future experiment and analysis, the trials can be set to different velocities.


## Analysis
1. Compute descriptive statistics, includin mean and std.
2. Performed Mixed-Design ANOVA using `pingouin`:
- Despite only one velocity is used in the experiment, analysis code is constructed to compare the effect within participant and between different trials.
- In order to make it capable of analyzing data when future experiment use different velocities in different trials, `velocity` should be added as an independent variable. 

## Usage
1. Load sample data from a CSV file.
2. Extract and compute reaction times.
3. Generate synthetic participant data if needed.
4. Visualize reaction time trends.
5. Perform statistical analysis to compare groups.

## Output
1. Reaction time plots for individual trials.
2. Aggregated reaction time plots across groups.
3. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation).
4. ANOVA test results.

## Note
- Adjust the simulation parameters as needed for different purposes.
